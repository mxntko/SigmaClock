# Advantages

- real time zone clock

# Flaws/Bugs

- the alarm doesn't pop up or sound (device/emulator problem that doesn't support it)
- the stopwatch has 2 resume buttons when paused (not old enough hehe)
- Triggered alarms will disappear if they are refreshed (return to home then enter the alarm page again), meaning you have to create them continuously, they cannot be saved
