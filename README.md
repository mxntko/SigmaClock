# Advantages

- real time zone clock

# Flaws/Bugs

- the alarm doesn't pop up or sound (device/emulator problem that doesn't support it)
- the stopwatch has 2 resume buttons when paused (not good enough hehe)
- Triggered alarms will disappear if they are refreshed (return to home then enter the alarm page again), meaning you have to create them continuously, they cannot be saved

# Warning

- Make sure to always delete the build file (it won't harm the code) in case it appears in the original file. If you refuse to delete it, there will be a chance of the device connected like emulator/web/etc to get exited when you run the code.
- Before runnning, go to terminal and always type 'flutter clean', 'flutter pub get', and 'flutter run' to make sure everything was set up.
